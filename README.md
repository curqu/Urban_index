# Urban_index
A python script for ArcMap 10.6 classifying urban, suburban and rural areas, based on GHSL.


To add: user should create a default geodatabase, called urbanindex.gdb, in their workspace folder - vector files will be created here. The defined workspace should be the parent folder of the geodatabase, NOT the geodatabase itself.
